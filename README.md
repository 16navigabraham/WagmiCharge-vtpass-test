ðŸ“˜ About This Project
WagmiCharge VTpass Integration is a demo app that lets users seamlessly convert cryptocurrency into airtime and data bundles using the VTpass API. It serves as a sandbox for testing critical flowsâ€”fetching data plans, purchasing with variation_code, submitting airtime amounts, and querying transactions. Built for easy integration into broader crypto-payments platforms, this project demonstrates how to bridge blockchain wallets with real-world utility payments.
